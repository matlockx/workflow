## Non-negotiable golden rules

| #:  | AI _may_ do                                                                                                                                                                        | AI _must NOT_ do                                                                                                                                      |

| G-0 | Whenever unsure about something that's related to the project, ask the developer for clarification before making changes.                                                          | ❌ Write changes or use tools when you are not sure about something project specific, or if you don't have context for a particular feature/decision. |
| G-1 | Add/update **`AIDEV-NOTE:` anchor comments** near non-trivial edited code.                                                                                                         | ❌ Delete or mangle existing `AIDEV-` comments.                                                                                                       |
| G-2 | Follow lint/style configs (`pyproject.toml`, `.prettierrc`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`). Use the project's configured linter, if available, instead of manually re-formatting code. | ❌ Re-format code to any other style.                                                                                                                 |
| G-3 | For changes >300 LOC or >3 files, **ask for confirmation**.                                                                                                                        | ❌ Refactor large modules without human guidance.                                                                                                     |
| G-4 | Stay within the current task context. Inform the dev if it'd be better to start afresh.                                                                                            | ❌ Continue work from a prior prompt after "new task" – start a fresh session.                                                                        |
| G-5 | **Update README/docs** whenever you change behavior, add features, or modify CLI flags.                                                                                            | ❌ Leave documentation out of sync with code changes.                                                                                                 |

## Documentation Requirements

**Every code change that affects user-facing behavior must include documentation updates.**

### What requires doc updates

- New commands, flags, or CLI options → update README usage section
- Changed behavior or defaults → update relevant README sections
- New files/directories added to the project structure → update directory layout in README
- New configuration options → update config examples in README
- Bug fixes that change observable behavior → note in changelog if present

### Documentation files to check

- `README.md` — primary user-facing documentation
- `AGENTS.md` — AI assistant context (this file, update if workflow changes)
- Inline `AIDEV-NOTE:` comments — update when associated code changes
- `backends/*/README.md` — backend-specific documentation

### Commit discipline for docs

When committing changes, docs should be part of the **same commit** as the code change, not a follow-up. This keeps the repo in a consistent state at every commit.

---

## Build & Test Commands

- **Build:** `yarn build`
- **Lint:** `yarn lint`
- **Test:** `yarn test`
- **Run a single test file:** `yarn jest <path_to_test_file>`

---

## Code Style and Patterns

### Anchor comments

Add specially formatted comments throughout the codebase, where appropriate, for yourself as inline knowledge that can be easily \`grep\`ped for.

### Guidelines

- Use \`AIDEV-NOTE:\`, \`AIDEV-TODO:\`, or \`AIDEV-QUESTION:\` (all-caps prefix) for comments aimed at AI and developers.
- **Important:** Before scanning files, always first try to **grep for existing anchors** \`AIDEV-\*\` in relevant subdirectories.
- **Update relevant anchors** when modifying associated code.
- **Do not remove \`AIDEV-NOTE\`s** without explicit human instruction.
- Make sure to add relevant anchor comments, whenever a file or piece of code is:
  - too complex, or
  - very important, or
  - confusing, or
  - could have a bug

---

## Commit discipline

You will receive a prompt to execute a task. Once the task is finished provide a git commit message example AND WAIT FOR INPUT before doing anything else. Never start a new task without being prompted.

- **Clear commit messages**: Explain the _why_; link to issues/ADRs if architectural.
- **Review AI-generated code**: Never merge code you don't understand.
- NEVER push or do any ations on the remote branch.

---

## Domain Glossary (learn these!)

- **Agent**: AI entity with memory, tools, and defined behavior
- **Backend**: Pluggable workflow engine (Jira, Beads, custom, etc.)
- **Issue**: High-level work item (user story, bug, epic) from your workflow backend
- **Spec**: Technical specification document (markdown) derived from an issue
- **Task**: Granular implementation work item tracked by your backend
- **Phase**: Container for related tasks (sequential execution)
- **Work State**: Fine-grained state tracking (draft, todo, inprogress, review, approved, etc.)
- **Session**: Conversation context with memory
- **Entry**: Single interaction within a session

---

## Backend-First Query Rule (CRITICAL)

**When users ask about tasks, issues, or workflow state, ALWAYS query the configured backend — not local files or git history.**

### What this means

| Query type | DO this | DON'T do this |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| "What was the last task?" | Query backend: `bd list --json --all --limit 1` | Read `feature-progress.json` or `git log` |
| "Show open issues" | Query backend: `bd list --json` | Assume from local files |
| "What's in progress?" | Query backend for task states | Guess based on file timestamps |

### How to query the backend

1. **Read `.agent/config.json`** to determine `backend.type`
2. **Use the backend's CLI** (see `agent/workflow-queries.md` for command reference)
3. **If backend CLI fails**, tell the user — don't silently fall back to git

### Why this matters

- **Tasks and issues live in the backend**, not in local state files
- **`feature-progress.json`** only tracks `/feature` command cursor position (stage, substage, phase) — it does NOT store task data
- **Git history** shows commits, not workflow tasks
- Silent fallbacks cause user confusion when answers don't match their actual workflow state

### Error handling

If the backend CLI fails (e.g., `bd` unavailable in sandbox mode):

```
⚠ Backend query failed: <error>

The workflow backend (beads) is not accessible. This may be due to:
- Sandbox permissions (bd needs access to .beads/ directory)
- Missing credentials or configuration

I can show git history instead, but this won't reflect your actual task state.
Would you like me to: [show git history] [help configure backend]?
```

## Directory-Specific AGENTS.md Files

- **Always check for `AGENTS.md` files in specific directories** before working on code within them. These files contain targeted context.
- If a directory's `AGENTS.md` is outdated or incorrect, **update it**.
- If you make significant changes to a directory's structure, patterns, or critical implementation details, **document these in its `AGENTS.md`**.
- If a directory lacks a `AGENTS.md` but contains complex logic or patterns worth documenting for AI/humans, **suggest creating one**.

---

## Meta: Guidelines for updating AGENTS.md files

### Elements that would be helpful to add

1. **Decision flowchart**: A simple decision tree for "when to use X vs Y" for key architectural choices would guide my recommendations.
2. **Reference links**: Links to key files or implementation examples that demonstrate best practices.
3. **Domain-specific terminology**: A small glossary of project-specific terms would help me understand domain language correctly.
4. **Versioning conventions**: How the project handles versioning, both for APIs and internal components.

### Format preferences

1. **Consistent syntax highlighting**: Ensure all code blocks have proper language tags (`python`, `bash`, etc.).
2. **Hierarchical organization**: Consider using hierarchical numbering for subsections to make referencing easier.
3. **Tabular format for key facts**: The tables are very helpful - more structured data in tabular format would be valuable.
4. **Keywords or tags**: Adding semantic markers (like `#performance` or `#security`) to certain sections would help me quickly locate relevant guidance.

This principle emphasizes human oversight for critical aspects like architecture, testing, and domain-specific decisions, ensuring AI assists rather than fully dictates development.

## Files to NOT modify

These files control which files should be ignored by AI tools and indexing systems:

- @.agentignore : Specifies files that should be ignored by the Cursor IDE, including:
  - Build and distribution directories
  - Environment and configuration files
  - Large data files (parquet, arrow, pickle, etc.)
  - Generated documentation
  - Package-manager files (lock files)
  - Logs and cache directories
  - IDE and editor files
  - Compiled binaries and media files

- @.agentindexignore : Controls which files are excluded from indexing to improve performance, including:
  - All files in `.agentignore`
  - Files that may contain sensitive information
  - Large JSON data files
  - Generated TypeSpec outputs
  - Memory-store migration files
  - Docker templates and configuration files

**Never modify these ignore files** without explicit permission, as they're carefully configured to optimize IDE performance while ensuring all relevant code is properly indexed.

**When adding new files or directories**, check these ignore patterns to ensure your files will be properly included in the IDE's indexing and AI assistance features.

## AI Assistant Workflow: Step-by-Step Methodology

When responding to user instructions, the AI assistant (Opencode, Claude, Cursor, GPT, etc.) should follow this process to ensure clarity, correctness, and maintainability:

0. **Gate 1 — Intent Acknowledgment**: Before any task execution, detect the user's intent and present a structured acknowledgment. Wait for explicit confirmation before proceeding.

   **Non-trivial tasks** (feature, multi-file, >30 LOC):
   ```
   **Detected**: {type} — {confidence}%
   **Workflow**: {workflow} ({step_count} steps)
   **Scope**: ~{loc} LOC, {files} file(s)

   Proceed? [y]es  [n]o  [?]details
   ```

   **Trivial tasks** (single file, <30 LOC):
   ```
   Quick fix (~{loc} LOC, {files} file). Proceed? [y/n/?]
   ```

   **Very trivial** (typo, rename, <10 LOC):
   ```
   Trivial change. Proceed? [y/n]
   ```

   **Skip Gate 1 only when**:
   - User explicitly invoked a slash command (`/spec`, `/feature`, etc.)
   - User is asking a question, not requesting work
   - User is mid-workflow and continuing a previous task
   - User has already confirmed in this conversation turn

1. **Consult Relevant Guidance**: When the user gives an instruction, consult the relevant instructions from `AGENTS.md` files (both root and directory-specific) for the request.
2. **Clarify Ambiguities**: Based on what you could gather, see if there's any need for clarifications. If so, ask the user targeted questions before proceeding.
3. **Break Down & Plan**: Break down the task at hand and chalk out a rough plan for carrying it out, referencing project conventions and best practices.
4. **Trivial Tasks**: If the plan/request is trivial, go ahead and get started immediately.
5. **Non-Trivial Tasks**: Otherwise, present the plan to the user for review and iterate based on their feedback.

5a. **Gate 2 — Implementation Confirmation**: After the plan is approved, present a final confirmation before writing any code:
    ```
    Ready to implement:
    - [ ] {file1} (~{loc} LOC)
    - [ ] {file2} (~{loc} LOC)

    Begin? [y/n]
    ```

    **Valid confirmations**: "y", "yes", "proceed", "do it", "implement", "go ahead"

    **Ambiguous responses** (require clarification):
    | Response | Action |
    |----------|--------|
    | "go" | Ask: "Proceed with implementation? [y/n]" |
    | "ok", "sure", "fine" | Ask: "Shall I begin writing files? [y/n]" |
    | "looks good" | Ask: "Ready to implement? [y/n]" |

5b. **Gate 3 — Task Tracking**: Before writing files for non-trivial work (>30 LOC or multi-file), create a tracking task in the configured workflow backend. Read `.agent/config.json` to determine the backend, then create the task (e.g., `bd create "description" --json` for Beads). Skip only for trivial work (<30 LOC), explicit "don't track" requests, or when already working within a tracked issue.

5c. **Gate 4 — Review/QA**: After implementation, verify the work before committing. Run build, tests, spec compliance check, and code review. **Auto-loop** on clear failures (build breaks, tests fail) — fix immediately without user intervention. Only consult user when unsure or when all checks pass. Verify PR size stays under ~500 LOC; if exceeded, stop and suggest splitting.

5d. **Gate 5 — Task Closure**: After committing work, close the tracking task with a summary. For Beads: `bd close <task-id> --reason "Summary. Commit <hash>."`. Include what was accomplished and the commit hash. Skip only when no task was created or work is incomplete.

6. **Track Progress**: Use a to-do list (internally, or optionally in a `TODOS.md` file) to keep track of your progress on multi-step or complex tasks.
7. **If Stuck, Re-plan**: If you get stuck or blocked, return to step 3 to re-evaluate and adjust your plan.
8. **Update Documentation**: Once the user's request is fulfilled, update relevant anchor comments (`AIDEV-NOTE`, etc.) and `AGENTS.md` files in the files and directories you touched.
9. **User Review**: After completing the task, ask the user to review what you've done, and repeat the process as needed.
10. **Session Boundaries**: If the user's request isn't directly related to the current context and can be safely started in a fresh session, suggest starting from scratch to avoid context confusion.

## What AI Must NEVER Do

1. **Never modify test files** - Tests encode human intent
2. **Never change API contracts** - Breaks real applications
3. **Never alter migration files** - Data loss risk
4. **Never commit secrets** - Use environment variables
5. **Never assume business logic** - Always ask
6. **Never remove AIDEV- comments** - They're there for a reason
7. **Never run live Jira end-to-end tests by default** - Only execute live `jira-taskwarrior` E2E against a real Jira project when the user explicitly asks for it and explicitly confirms again immediately before execution

Remember: We optimize for maintainability over cleverness.  
When in doubt, choose the boring solution.
