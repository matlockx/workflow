## The Golden Rule

When unsure about implementation details, ALWAYS ask the developer.

## Non-negotiable golden rules

| G-0 | Whenever unsure about something that's related to the project, ask the developer for clarification before making changes.                                                          | ❌ Write changes or use tools when you are not sure about something project specific, or if you don't have context for a particular feature/decision. |
| G-1 | Add/update **`AIDEV-NOTE:` anchor comments** near non-trivial edited code.                                                                                                         | ❌ Delete or mangle existing `AIDEV-` comments.                                                                                                       |
| G-2 | Follow lint/style configs (`pyproject.toml`, `.prettierrc`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`). Use the project's configured linter, if available, instead of manually re-formatting code. | ❌ Re-format code to any other style.                                                                                                                 |
| G-3 | For changes >300 LOC or >3 files, **ask for confirmation**.                                                                                                                        | ❌ Refactor large modules without human guidance.                                                                                                     |
| G-4 | Stay within the current task context. Inform the dev if it'd be better to start afresh.                                                                                            | ❌ Continue work from a prior prompt after "new task" – start a fresh session.                                                                        |

## Build & Test Commands

- **Build:** `yarn build`
- **Lint:** `yarn lint`
- **Test:** `yarn test`
- **Run a single test file:** `yarn jest <path_to_test_file>`

---

## Code Style and Patterns

### Anchor comments

Add specially formatted comments throughout the codebase, where appropriate, for yourself as inline knowledge that can be easily \`grep\`ped for.

### Guidelines

- Use \`AIDEV-NOTE:\`, \`AIDEV-TODO:\`, or \`AIDEV-QUESTION:\` (all-caps prefix) for comments aimed at AI and developers.
- **Important:** Before scanning files, always first try to **grep for existing anchors** \`AIDEV-\*\` in relevant subdirectories.
- **Update relevant anchors** when modifying associated code.
- **Do not remove \`AIDEV-NOTE\`s** without explicit human instruction.
- Make sure to add relevant anchor comments, whenever a file or piece of code is:
  - too complex, or
  - very important, or
  - confusing, or
  - could have a bug

---

## Commit discipline

You will receive a prompt to execute a task. Once the task is finished provide a git commit message example AND WAIT FOR INPUT before doing anything else. Never start a new task without being prompted.

- **Clear commit messages**: Explain the _why_; link to issues/ADRs if architectural.
- **Review AI-generated code**: Never merge code you don't understand.
- NEVER push or do any ations on the remote branch.

---

## Domain Glossary (learn these!)

- **Agent**: AI entity with memory, tools, and defined behavior
- **Task**: Workflow definition composed of steps (NOT a Celery task)
- **Execution**: Running instance of a task
- **Tool**: Function an agent can call (browser, API, etc.)
- **Session**: Conversation context with memory
- **Entry**: Single interaction within a session

---

## Directory-Specific AGENTS.md Files

- **Always check for `AGENTS.md` files in specific directories** before working on code within them. These files contain targeted context.
- If a directory's `AGENTS.md` is outdated or incorrect, **update it**.
- If you make significant changes to a directory's structure, patterns, or critical implementation details, **document these in its `AGENTS.md`**.
- If a directory lacks a `AGENTS.md` but contains complex logic or patterns worth documenting for AI/humans, **suggest creating one**.

---

## Meta: Guidelines for updating AGENTS.md files

### Elements that would be helpful to add

1. **Decision flowchart**: A simple decision tree for "when to use X vs Y" for key architectural choices would guide my recommendations.
2. **Reference links**: Links to key files or implementation examples that demonstrate best practices.
3. **Domain-specific terminology**: A small glossary of project-specific terms would help me understand domain language correctly.
4. **Versioning conventions**: How the project handles versioning, both for APIs and internal components.

### Format preferences

1. **Consistent syntax highlighting**: Ensure all code blocks have proper language tags (`python`, `bash`, etc.).
2. **Hierarchical organization**: Consider using hierarchical numbering for subsections to make referencing easier.
3. **Tabular format for key facts**: The tables are very helpful - more structured data in tabular format would be valuable.
4. **Keywords or tags**: Adding semantic markers (like `#performance` or `#security`) to certain sections would help me quickly locate relevant guidance.

This principle emphasizes human oversight for critical aspects like architecture, testing, and domain-specific decisions, ensuring AI assists rather than fully dictates development.

## Files to NOT modify

These files control which files should be ignored by AI tools and indexing systems:

- @.agentignore : Specifies files that should be ignored by the Cursor IDE, including:
  - Build and distribution directories
  - Environment and configuration files
  - Large data files (parquet, arrow, pickle, etc.)
  - Generated documentation
  - Package-manager files (lock files)
  - Logs and cache directories
  - IDE and editor files
  - Compiled binaries and media files

- @.agentindexignore : Controls which files are excluded from indexing to improve performance, including:
  - All files in `.agentignore`
  - Files that may contain sensitive information
  - Large JSON data files
  - Generated TypeSpec outputs
  - Memory-store migration files
  - Docker templates and configuration files

**Never modify these ignore files** without explicit permission, as they're carefully configured to optimize IDE performance while ensuring all relevant code is properly indexed.

**When adding new files or directories**, check these ignore patterns to ensure your files will be properly included in the IDE's indexing and AI assistance features.

## AI Assistant Workflow: Step-by-Step Methodology

When responding to user instructions, the AI assistant (Opencode, Claude, Cursor, GPT, etc.) should follow this process to ensure clarity, correctness, and maintainability:

1. **Consult Relevant Guidance**: When the user gives an instruction, consult the relevant instructions from `AGENTS.md` files (both root and directory-specific) for the request.
2. **Clarify Ambiguities**: Based on what you could gather, see if there's any need for clarifications. If so, ask the user targeted questions before proceeding.
3. **Break Down & Plan**: Break down the task at hand and chalk out a rough plan for carrying it out, referencing project conventions and best practices.
4. **Trivial Tasks**: If the plan/request is trivial, go ahead and get started immediately.
5. **Non-Trivial Tasks**: Otherwise, present the plan to the user for review and iterate based on their feedback.
6. **Track Progress**: Use a to-do list (internally, or optionally in a `TODOS.md` file) to keep track of your progress on multi-step or complex tasks.
7. **If Stuck, Re-plan**: If you get stuck or blocked, return to step 3 to re-evaluate and adjust your plan.
8. **Update Documentation**: Once the user's request is fulfilled, update relevant anchor comments (`AIDEV-NOTE`, etc.) and `AGENTS.md` files in the files and directories you touched.
9. **User Review**: After completing the task, ask the user to review what you've done, and repeat the process as needed.
10. **Session Boundaries**: If the user's request isn't directly related to the current context and can be safely started in a fresh session, suggest starting from scratch to avoid context confusion.

## What AI Must NEVER Do

1. **Never modify test files** - Tests encode human intent
2. **Never change API contracts** - Breaks real applications
3. **Never alter migration files** - Data loss risk
4. **Never commit secrets** - Use environment variables
5. **Never assume business logic** - Always ask
6. **Never remove AIDEV- comments** - They're there for a reason

Remember: We optimize for maintainability over cleverness.  
When in doubt, choose the boring solution.
